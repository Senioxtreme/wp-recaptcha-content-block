# reCAPTCHA Content Block for WordPress

## Description
**reCAPTCHA Content Block** is a WordPress plugin that allows you to protect specific content within your website by requiring users to complete a Google reCAPTCHA verification before displaying the content. Itâ€™s ideal for hiding sensitive information like email addresses, documents, or any other content from bots and spammers.

This plugin integrates seamlessly with the Gutenberg block editor, allowing you to easily add a protected content block anywhere on your WordPress site. Once the reCAPTCHA challenge is completed successfully, the hidden content is revealed.

## Features
- **Simple integration with Gutenberg**: Add a reCAPTCHA-protected block directly from the block editor.
- **Protect sensitive information**: Ideal for hiding email addresses, phone numbers, or links until the user has verified they are human.
- **Customizable button text**: You can now modify the button text that appears before revealing the protected content.
- **Support for multiple block types**: In addition to text, you can include images, videos, galleries, or any other Gutenberg block inside the protected area.
- **Google reCAPTCHA v2 support**: Utilizes the Google reCAPTCHA v2 checkbox to ensure human verification.
