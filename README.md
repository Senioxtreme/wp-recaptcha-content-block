# reCAPTCHA Content Block for WordPress

## Description
**reCAPTCHA Content Block** is a WordPress plugin that allows you to protect specific content within your website by requiring users to complete a Google reCAPTCHA verification before displaying the content. Itâ€™s particularly useful for hiding public email addresses or other sensitive information from bots and spammers.

This plugin integrates seamlessly with the Gutenberg block editor, allowing you to easily add a protected content block anywhere on your WordPress site. Once the reCAPTCHA challenge is completed successfully, the hidden content is revealed.

- **Easy to use:** No coding skills required. Just insert the block, add your content, and configure reCAPTCHA keys.
- **Customizable:** Protect any type of content that requires user verification.
- **reCAPTCHA v2 support:** Utilizes the Google reCAPTCHA v2 checkbox to ensure human verification.

1. Install and activate the plugin.
2. Go to the **Settings > reCAPTCHA Content Block** menu and enter your Google reCAPTCHA site and secret keys.
